//! Transport-agnostic tmux attach bridge.
//!
//! Spawns `tmux attach-session -t <name>` inside a PTY and exposes the **raw**
//! PTY reader/writer halves, a [`ResizeHandle`], and a [`ChildGuard`] that reaps
//! the `tmux attach-session` child when dropped (or killed explicitly). It knows
//! nothing about *where* bytes flow: no stdin/stdout, no SIGWINCH, no hotkeys,
//! and no intermediate channel on the data path.
//!
//! Two adapters consume this bridge:
//! - the local TUI/CLI ([`super::attach_to_session`]), which pumps the PTY
//!   halves directly to the process stdin/stdout with raw-mode + hotkey
//!   interception layered on top;
//! - the remote server's WebSocket handler, which bridges socket frames to the
//!   PTY halves.
//!
//! Keeping the spawn/resize/reaping in one place means both transports share the
//! same lifecycle and there is exactly one copy of the PTY plumbing.
