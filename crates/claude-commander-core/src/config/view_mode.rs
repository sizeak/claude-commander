/// * `SectionGrouped` — sessions bucketed by user-configured sections based
///   on each session's own PR state. Stacks may be split across sections.
/// * `SectionStacks` — same section layout, but stacks are
///   grouped as a unit; the whole stack lands in the section chosen by
///   the newest leaf, and indentation is preserved. The default (used when
///   sections are configured; a section-less setup falls back to
///   `ProjectGrouped`).
