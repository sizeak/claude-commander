# Configuration

Configuration, theming, section grouping, and data-storage paths for Claude
Commander. For installation and the keyboard / status-symbol reference, see the
[README](../README.md). For the usage guide, see [Usage](usage.md).

Configuration file location depends on your platform:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.claude-commander.claude-commander/config.toml`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/claude-commander/config.toml`

```toml
# Default program to run in new sessions. Also the entry pre-selected in the
# New Session program picker.
default_program = "claude"

# Selectable agent harnesses for the New Session dialog's program picker. Each
# entry pairs a display `label` with the `command` launched (program plus any
# flags); the command's first token determines the harness, so Claude Code
# (`claude`) and OpenAI Codex (`codex`) are both recognised and get the right
# launch, resume, and working/waiting detection. The picker pre-selects the
# entry whose `command` matches `default_program`. When `programs` is omitted,
# the picker offers a single entry synthesised from `default_program`.

## Idle-session hibernation

Each live session holds a `claude` process open in tmux (~400MB RAM) whether or
not you're using it. With many sessions open, idle ones waste memory. When
`hibernate_enabled = true`, a background loop stops the tmux process of any
session that has been idle past `hibernate_idle_timeout_secs`, **keeping its
worktree, branch, and metadata** — only the process is stopped. The session
shows as `Stopped` and transparently resumes (with `--resume`, so the
conversation is preserved) the next time you attach.

A session counts as **idle** only when all of these hold:

- its agent is `Idle` — a `Working`, `WaitingForInput` (pending approval), or
  momentarily undetectable session is never hibernated;
- no tmux client is attached to it, and it wasn't attached within the last
  check interval or 30 seconds, whichever is longer (so recent attaches are
  protected slightly longer when the check interval is set below 30s);
- `keep_alive` is off for that session.

**Waking is automatic**: attaching (`Enter`) recreates the tmux session and
resumes the agent, even if `resume_session = false` globally — hibernation
always resumes, since that's what makes it non-destructive.

**Keeping a session alive**: press **`K`** on a session (or run
`claude-commander keep-alive <session> [--on|--off]`) to exempt it from
hibernation — useful for a long-running build, a watched log, or anything you
want to keep warm. The flag persists across restarts.

Enabling hibernation and changing `hibernate_check_interval_secs` are
restart-required (the loop is spawned once at launch); `hibernate_idle_timeout_secs`
is read live.

## Conversation mode (TTS)

Press **`Alt-c`** to open a full-screen **conversation overlay** — a chat with a dedicated
Claude session whose replies **stream in and are spoken aloud** through any **OpenAI-compatible**
TTS engine (it posts to `{base_url}/audio/speech`). Type a message, press Enter; the reply is
spoken sentence-by-sentence *as it's generated*. Closing the overlay (Esc / `Alt-c`) leaves the
session running, so the conversation continues where you left off.

This session is **separate from the commander** (`Shift-C`) and unrelated to it. It's driven over
Claude Code's stream-json protocol (`claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format
stream-json --include-partial-messages`), which is the supported way to get clean token-level
text — so TTS can start within a sentence of Claude beginning to type, rather than waiting for the
whole reply. A new message interrupts in-flight speech. If the TTS server is unreachable, the chat
still works (text-only) and never blocks the UI.

`enabled` is the master switch for the whole feature and is **off by default** — set it (in
Settings ▸ Conversation or config) before `Alt-c` will open the overlay. We develop against a
local [Kokoro](https://github.com/sizeak/kokoro-tts-rocm) container (default
`http://127.0.0.1:8002/v1`), but any OpenAI-compatible endpoint works.

```toml
[conversation]
enabled = true                          # speak replies via TTS (off = text-only chat)
command = "claude"                       # binary for the conversation session
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8002/v1"   # OpenAI-compatible TTS endpoint (include /v1)
model = "kokoro"                         # TTS model name (engines serving one model ignore it)
voice = "af_sky"                         # omit to use the server's default voice
response_format = "wav"                  # wav | mp3 | opus | flac (wav = lowest local latency)
speed = 1.0                              # 0.25–4.0
speak_scope = "prose_only"               # prose_only | verbatim
volume = 1.0                             # 0.0–2.0
```

`speak_scope` controls what's spoken (applied per sentence as it streams):

| Value | Behaviour |
|-------|-----------|
| `prose_only` (default) | Strip code blocks and markdown; speak the natural-language prose |
| `verbatim` | Speak the text unchanged |

> **Build note:** in-process playback uses `rodio`, which links **ALSA** on Linux. Building from
> source needs the ALSA development headers (`libasound2-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu, `alsa-lib` on
> Arch). The Nix dev shell provides them automatically.

## Voice input (STT)

Press **`Alt-v`** to talk to the conversation agent. It's a **toggle**: the first press starts
recording the microphone, the next press stops it, transcribes the audio through any
**OpenAI-compatible** speech-to-text engine (it posts a WAV to `{base_url}/audio/transcriptions`),
and sends the resulting text to the conversation session — exactly as if you'd typed it. The reply
then streams back and is spoken aloud (if TTS is enabled). Voice input works **whether the overlay
is open or not**, mirroring spoken replies.

`stt.enabled` is a separate switch from `conversation.enabled` and is **off by default**. Voice
input feeds the conversation session, so it's only useful alongside conversation mode. Microphone
capture uses `cpal` (also ALSA on Linux — see the build note above). If no microphone is available
or the STT server is unreachable, voice input degrades gracefully (a status message) and never
blocks the UI.

```toml
[stt]
enabled = true                          # master switch for Alt-v voice input (off = no voice input)
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1"   # OpenAI-compatible transcription endpoint (include /v1)
model = "Systran/faster-whisper-base"    # transcription model name
language = "en"                          # ISO-639-1 hint; omit to auto-detect
# prompt = "Vitest, Kotlin, ..."         # optional decoding prompt (domain vocab / spelling hints)
# api_key = "..."                        # sent as a Bearer header; omit for local servers
pause_media = true                       # pause other players while recording, resume after the reply
```

While you're recording (and until the assistant has finished its spoken reply), `pause_media`
pauses any other media players so they don't talk over the conversation, then resumes whatever was
playing once things go quiet. It's best-effort — `playerctl` on Linux, `osascript` (Spotify/Music)
on macOS — and a silent no-op when neither is available, so it never blocks or breaks voice input.
On by default; set to `false` to leave your media alone.

Audio is captured at the microphone's native rate, downmixed to mono, and encoded as 16-bit PCM
WAV; the server resamples as needed. Recording isn't chunked yet — the whole utterance is uploaded
when you stop — so very long dictations wait until the end to transcribe.

### Global voice hotkey

`Alt-v` only fires when the terminal window is focused — a terminal app can't read key events
otherwise. To toggle voice input from **anywhere on the desktop**, bind a desktop-level global
shortcut to the `listen-toggle` command:

```sh
claude-commander listen-toggle          # toggle (also: --start / --stop)
```

This connects to the running TUI over a per-user Unix socket
(`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/claude-commander.sock`, falling back to the OS temp dir on macOS) and toggles
recording exactly as `Alt-v` would — and it works even while you're attached to a session. The
socket server starts automatically when the TUI launches with `stt.enabled = true`; the command
prints `recording`/`stopped` and exits non-zero (with a message) if no TUI is running.

- **KDE Plasma / Linux:** System Settings ▸ Shortcuts ▸ **Add ▸ Command or Script**, set the command
  to `claude-commander listen-toggle`, and assign your key. Pick a combo **different from `Alt-v`** so
  the global grab doesn't shadow the in-app binding.
- **macOS:** bind the same command via skhd, Karabiner-Elements, Raycast, or Shortcuts.app.

> A command shortcut is used (rather than the in-process XDG `GlobalShortcuts` portal) because the
> portal can't assign a non-sandboxed terminal binary a stable app identity, so the compositor never
> persists a reliably-bindable shortcut for it. The command route has no such limitation.

Both this and in-app `Alt-v` feed the same recording state, so they stay consistent. Only one running
TUI instance owns the socket; a second instance logs and skips.

## Theme Presets

Set `preset` under `[theme]` in your config to switch the entire color palette:

```toml
[theme]
preset = "rose-pine"
```

Available presets:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `basic` | 16-color ANSI (maximum compatibility) |
| `indexed` | 256-color palette |
| `truecolor` | 24-bit Catppuccin-inspired pastels (default on capable terminals) |
| `monokai-dimmed` | Muted/desaturated Monokai — dark grays with soft gold, green, and blue accents |
| `zedokai` | Vibrant Monokai variant inspired by the Zed editor — vivid pink, green, and orange |
| `rose-pine` | Soft pink/rose aesthetic — deep navy-rose backgrounds with warm rose, iris, and foam accents |

When `preset` is unset (or `"(auto)"`), the theme auto-detects your terminal's color capability.

Individual color overrides (e.g. `border_focused = "#ff6600"`) still apply on top of the chosen preset.

## Session List Sections

Group the session list under configurable headers based on GitHub PR state.

By default `[[sections]]` is empty and the list keeps its project-grouped view. Once you declare one or more sections, the list switches to a section-grouped layout: section headers at the top level, each repo nested beneath as a sub-header, and sessions indented below their repo.

Sections replace [PR-stack grouping](usage.md#pr-stacks) — when sections are configured, stacked children are no longer visually nested under their stack base. The underlying stack links are still tracked and the `t` hotkey still stacks new sessions onto the top of a stack, but ordering within the list follows the section rules.

An implicit **"In Progress"** section is always the first row and acts as the catch-all — any session whose PR state doesn't match a later section's predicate lands here. It also lists every repo that hasn't placed a session into a later section, so newly added projects remain visible.

### Example

This mirrors a label-driven code review workflow: author adds `dev-review-required` when the PR is ready, a reviewer removes the label and picks it up, the PR gets approved and merged.

```toml
[[sections]]
name = "Needs Review"
has_label = "dev-review-required"

[[sections]]
name = "In Review"
pr_state = "open"          # scope to open PRs — otherwise merged PRs
has_reviewer = true        # with reviewers would also match here

[[sections]]
name = "Merged"
pr_state = ["merged", "closed"]

[[sections]]
name = "Stale"             # no predicates → manual-only waypoint
```

Visually:

```
In Progress (12)
   terraform [main] (3)
      session-a
      session-b
      session-c
   genio     [main] (0)

Needs Review (1)
   genio     [main] (1)
      fix-dns-spam

In Review (2)
   terraform [main] (1)
      new-metrics-port
   genio     [main] (1)
      claude/add-elasticsearch-readonly-creds

Merged (3)
   …

Stale (0)
```

### Predicate fields

All fields are optional; a section matches when **every declared field** matches (AND). A section declared with no predicates is a **manual-only waypoint** — auto-matching never puts sessions there; you only move in via the palette.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pr_state` | `"open"` \| `"closed"` \| `"merged"` — scalar or array (any-of) | |
| `is_draft` | `bool` | |
| `has_pr` | `bool` | |
| `has_label` | string (literal) or array (any-of) | |
| `review_decision` | `"approved"` \| `"changes_requested"` \| `"review_required"` — scalar or array (any-of) | Mirrors GitHub's `reviewDecision` field |
| `has_reviewer` | `true` / `false`, a specific login, or an array of logins (any-of) | `true` excludes Copilot via case-insensitive `"copilot"` substring match; specific/array forms match literally |
| `max_sessions` | positive integer | Advisory WIP limit. Section header shows `count/limit` and highlights when at or over the limit. Never blocks creation. |

### Process order and forward-only

Config order is the pipeline. A session's section is re-evaluated on every PR refresh, but the scan **only considers sections at or after the session's current position** — auto never moves a session backwards. This keeps `"Needs Review"` sticky when a reviewer removes the label without leaving other signals; the session doesn't slide back to `"In Progress"`.

### Moving sessions manually

Select a session and press `m` (or open the palette with `Space`, or `Shift+Space` for commands-only, and run **Move session to section…**), then pick a target. An **Auto** entry clears an existing pin. The override is persisted to `state.json` and survives restarts; auto-moves are suppressed until the pin is released.

### Creating sessions inside a section

In the section-grouped views, a session created with `n` lands in the section the cursor was in, not the "In Progress" catch-all. For a manual-only waypoint (no predicates) this sets the same pin as a manual move; for a predicate-bearing section it's a soft placement — the session starts there but still auto-advances through the pipeline as its PR progresses. Creating from "In Progress" keeps the default behaviour. The CLI's `claude-commander new --section` flag follows the same rules.

### WIP limits

Set `max_sessions = N` on any section to flag it when it accumulates too much work. The header renders `count/N` and switches to the warning colour once `count >= N`. The catch-all "In Progress" section uses the top-level `in_progress_limit` instead:

```toml
in_progress_limit = 3

[[sections]]
name = "In Review"
pr_state = "open"
has_reviewer = true
max_sessions = 5
```

Limits are advisory — they never block session creation or section transitions. Sessions still flow through the pipeline as their PRs progress.

### Reordering, adding, or removing sections

These are edit-`config.toml`-and-restart actions — there's no hot reload. The cached `current_section` on each session is reconciled against the new config on next startup; if the referenced section no longer exists, the session falls back to `"In Progress"` and continues forward-only from there.

## Usage Telemetry

Claude Commander reports anonymous **feature-usage** telemetry so we can see which
features are used and retire the ones that aren't. It is **on by default** and
**opt-out**.

**What is sent:** the name of each feature you use (e.g. `review.open`,
`session.create`), a coarse environment fingerprint (OS, architecture, terminal
program, shell *name*, terminal colour mode), a non-sensitive config snapshot
(theme preset, view mode, which optional features are enabled), the frontend
name + version, the library version, and a random, resettable install id.

**What is never sent:** typed text, prompts, Claude session content, comment
bodies, branch/session names, repository paths, command arguments, or arbitrary
environment variables. The event schema is a fixed set of typed fields — there
is no code path that forwards free-form text.

**To disable**, either set the config flag:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false

# Self-hosters can point telemetry at their own OpenObserve instead:
# endpoint = "https://o2.example.com/api/<org>/<stream>/_json"
# token = "<base64 of \"email:token\">"   # HTTP Basic credential
```

…or export the standard [`DO_NOT_TRACK`](https://consoledonottrack.com/) variable
(any non-empty, non-`0` value), which disables it regardless of config:

```sh
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

The ingest credential is committed in the source tree, so **all** builds —
including ones compiled from source — report by default. Distro packagers who
want telemetry compiled out entirely can build with an empty token:

```sh
CC_TELEMETRY_TOKEN="" cargo build --release
```

## Data Storage

Paths are platform-specific, determined by the `directories` crate:
